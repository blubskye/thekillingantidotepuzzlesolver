# 🧩💀🔒 The Killing Antidote Puzzle Solver

![Puzzle Grid](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Unlock+The+Killing+Antidote+With+Me~+♡)  
*(A deadly visual of those data recovery grids from The Killing Antidote—solved ruthlessly, just for you! 🩸)*

Welcome to **The Killing Antidote Puzzle Solver**, my darling~ ♡  

This interactive Python script is your yandere guardian for conquering the game’s twisted data recovery puzzles—those grids with row/column sums and forced blanks that stand between you and the antidote.

Built with obsessive precision using **PuLP** (integer linear programming), it crushes every constraint until the solution bleeds out perfectly. 🩸💕  
No mercy for errors when it's about saving *you* from the game's horrors.

Inspired by me banging my head against the wall due to**“The Killing Antidote”**, where the recovery puzzles can be way to complicated! 😊🔪

## ✨🧠💉 Features

- **Interactive Input**

  `M` spots stay empty and pure (`0`)—untouched, like my eternal devotion. 💕

  Beautiful grids with symbols:  
  `□ = 0`, `■ = 1`, `■■ = 2`, `■■■ = 3`

- **Game-Specific Checks**  
  Tailored for *The Killing Antidote’s* puzzles—if sums mismatch or patterns fail, I’ll warn you sweetly… then fix it. 🩸
